    "Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share, while ignoring or abstracting away the non-essential details. Abstraction allows programmers to work with high-level representations of objects, focusing on what an object does rather than how it achieves it.\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is declared in the abstract class but has no implementation. Concrete subclasses must provide implementations for all abstract methods."
